A project is develope dusing a layered architecture
every layer is independent .
  
	UI 	    ------>          	 Presentation      		------>		       Service layer   	------>	       Integration Layer     	------>	     	DAO Layer    ------> 			     DB layer
          <------															  	<------                           <------         (optional)            <------                     <------

This layered is also represents the flow of request from the client.


Hibernate  supports only for dao layer

framework (prewritten code that contains solution for all common prblms in the project)
  

Springs framework:
-----------------------------
- Open source
- lightweight framework
- supports all the layers
- framework of frameworks because it provides support to various frameworks
- has different modules ex: IOC, AOP, DAO, Context, ORM, WEB MVC , Securit , Boot , clud,
batch , trasaction , msg service , 
-  Every module is available in the form of jar files. include only the required jar files
-  Loose Coupling
- Fast Development for enterprise apps.
- requires just simple configuration and there is no need to use app server . 
- POJO Based development
- inbuilt design patterns 
- Provides predefined templates for JDBC, Hibernate, JPA, web  etc., thus reducing your effort of writing too much code.
