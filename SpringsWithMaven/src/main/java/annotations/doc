- Autowiring optional with attribute required=”false”
	@Autowire by default is a type driven injection.
	@Qualifier spring annotation can be used to further fine-tune autowiring.
-@Resource (javax.annotation.Resource) annotation can be used for wiring by name.


@Resource annotation marks a resource that is needed by the application. 
It is analogous to @Autowired in that both injects beans by type when no attribute provided. 
But with name attribute, @Resource allows you to inject a bean by it’s name, 
which @Autowired does not.



@RequestMapping
 @RequestMapping spring annotation to map URLs onto an entire class or a particular handler method


@Autowired	Constructor, Field, Method	Declares a constructor, field, setter method, or configuration method to be autowired by type. Items annotated with @Autowired do not have to be public.

@Configurable	Type	Used with <context:springconfigured> to declare types whose properties should be injected, even if they are not instantiated by Spring. Typically used to inject the properties of domain objects.

@Order	Type, Method, Field	Defines ordering, as an alternative to implementing the org. springframework.core.Ordered interface.

@Qualifier	Field, Parameter, Type, Annotation Type	Guides autowiring to be performed by means other than by type.
To resolve any autowiring ambiguity, use the @Qualifier attribute with @Autowired.


@Required	Method (setters)	Specifies that a particular property must be injected or else the configuration will fail.
 Spring will throw a BeanInitializationException and context creation will fail.

@Scope	Type	Specifies the scope of a bean, either singleton, prototype, request, session, or some custom scope.
