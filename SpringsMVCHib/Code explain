springs with hib:
---------------------

we need 3 types of business classes:
1.controller   -> Spring mvc code
2.service      -> busines logic , validation , throw exception
3.dao          -> hibernate code

for all above classes, objs are created by springs.

pojo classes:
--------------
entity class
response dto
request dto
form class

for all above classes, objs are created by dev using springs 

util:
-----
ErrorEnum   -> class maintains all the error code + error message

add new error or any change in the error msg + error code in future refer only the ErrorEnum.java

exception:
-------------
for custom exception to handle the negative scenarios in project

Flow:
---------

UI ------> EmployeeController    ------> EmployeeService  -----> EmployeeDao ----->  Database




How do a Business class   pass the data or receive the data from the another Business class?
ans)
using the objects (dto/entity/request/response) 



In controller:
------------------

for every url we need to write a controller method


For controller method use the annotations:
--------------------------------------------
@RequestMapping(value = "", method = RequestMethod.POST)
@RequestParam("id")   -> get single  req data
@ModelAttribute("employee") -> get all  req data in the form of obj
@Valid -> to perfom validation using hibernate-validator framework






when login is succes save the customer basic info in the session
during the  logout delete the customer basic info from the session
